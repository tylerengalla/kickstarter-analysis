# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for our 'customer,' Louise who is looking to crowdfund her playwrite 'Fever.' She has an estimated budget of $10k but doesn't have any insight into how her campaign will do or what factors play into her success. 

To help, I've done a deep analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns similar to Louise' to help her understand the realities of her goal.

We start by doing an analysis of all campaigns to get an idea of general success rates.

What's important to Louise and what we found is that out of 912 theater campaigns in the US, 58% of those found success in reaching their funding goals.

Theater category consists of Musicals, Plays, and Spaces however. So let's filter by subcategory and just look at Plays. 
Similar trend - we find 61% success with plays in reaching funding goals.

So we understand how Plays fair with Kickstarter Campaigns, but when would be the right time for us to launch?

Early summer, in May/ June yields the most successful campaigns.

Louis was also interested in Great Britain's theater market, especially Musicals. But we just want to give her the big picture and create box plots using statistical computations.

From these plots, we can see that the Mean campaign goal is around $4000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than $4000. Half of the campagins goals are less than $2000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
