# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for our 'customer,' Louise who is looking to crowdfund her playwrite 'Fever.' She has an estimated budget of $10k but doesn't have any insight into how her campaign will do or what factors play into her success. 

To help, I've done a deep analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns similar to Louise' to help her understand the realities of her goal. 

We start by doing an analysis of all campaigns to get an idea of general success rates.

What's important to Louise and what we found is that out of 912 theater campaigns in the US, 58% of those found success in reaching their funding goals. 

Theater category consists of Musicals, Plays, and Spaces however. So let's filter by subcategory and just look at Plays. 
Similar trend - we find 61% success with plays in reaching funding goals. 

So we're liking our chances but when would be the right time for us to launch? 


Early summer in May/ June yields the most successful campaigns. 


Louis was also interested in Great Britain's theater market, especially Musicals. Let's give her the big picture and create box plos using statistical computations.
